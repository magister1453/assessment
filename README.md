This is the back end of my assessment, written in Java 8 using Spring. I use Spring MVC for the RESTful controllers and Spring Data JPA to hit a MySQL database. I'm using JWT for security.

There are three RESTful end points. All queries must include the Content-Type application/json header:

POST https://pulcher.serveo.net/api/auth/signup
which requires the following JSON example:
{
	"name":"Test",
	"username":"Test",
	"password":"Test123",
	"email":"a@b.com"
}

POST https://pulcher.serveo.net/api/auth/signin
which requires the following JSON example:
{
	"username":"Test",
	"password":"Test123"
}

GET https://pulcher.serveo.net/api/provider?max_discharges=5&min_discharges=6&max_average_covered_charges=50000
&min_average_covered_charges=40000&min_average_medicare_payments=6000
&max_average_medicare_payments=10000&state=GA&required_fields=Provider Name

The token generated by the signin URL must be included as a header. For example:
Key: Authorization Value: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxIiwiaWF0IjoxNTQ5NTUxODM5LCJleHAiOjE1NTAxNTY2Mzl9.ScxAygaZd1KTaXNwgIivn2GfwLRS3SKgUFqRJBcXvPeoc81QY4xNByOPNbNJAR9-D1K3w35rOJgMErVxaSZ7xw

require_fields is a comma-delimited list. If it isn't present all fields will be returned. Below are the possible fields:
Provider Name;
Provider Street Address;
Provider City;
Provider State;
Provider Zip Code;
Hospital Referral Region Description;
Total Discharges;
Average Covered Charges;
Average Total Payments;
Average Medicare Payments
